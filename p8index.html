                <p> JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.</p>
                <p>JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
                      <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language</li>

                <p>JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side validation,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
                    </li>
                    <li>Displaying clocks etc.

                    Java is an object-oriented programming language primarily used for developing complex enterprise applications. JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. Java applications can run in any virtual machine(JVM) or browser.
                </p>
         
                <p>
                    Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                   java is  Strongly typed language is used, and data type of variable is decided before declaring or using it while js Language utilised is loosely typed, so that the user does not have to worry about the data type before the declaration

            <h2>Hello_world</h2>
            <article>
                A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.
                <code>
                    // the hello world program
                    console.log('Hello World');
                </code>

                <p> Output:
                  <h3><br> Hello, World!</p></h3>
            </article>

             <section id="Variables">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatically</li>
                        <li>Using var</li>
                        <li> Using let</li>
                        <li>Using const</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.</p>
                    <p>The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.</p>
                    <p>The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.</p>
                    <p>The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.</p>
